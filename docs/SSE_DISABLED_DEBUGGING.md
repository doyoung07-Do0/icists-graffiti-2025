# SSE Disabled for Debugging

## Problem

The application was experiencing infinite SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections, causing:

- Massive number of connections (30+ connections per second)
- Server performance degradation
- Browser memory issues
- Console spam with connection logs

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Disabled SSE Endpoint**

- **File:** `app/api/teams/events/route.ts`
- **Change:** Endpoint now returns 503 status with "SSE disabled for debugging"
- **Effect:** No new SSE connections can be established

### 2. **Disabled SSE Broadcasting**

- **File:** `app/api/admin/round-status/route.ts`
- **Change:** Commented out `broadcastRoundStatusUpdate` calls
- **Effect:** No SSE messages are broadcast when round status changes

- **File:** `app/api/teams/[round]/[team]/route.ts`
- **Change:** Commented out `sendTeamUpdate` calls
- **Effect:** No SSE messages are broadcast when team data changes

### 3. **Disabled SSE Hooks**

- **File:** `hooks/useSSE.ts`
- **Change:** Hook now returns mock state with "SSE disabled for debugging"
- **Effect:** Components using SSE hooks won't attempt to connect

- **File:** `hooks/useRoundStatusUpdates.ts`
- **Change:** Hook now returns mock state
- **Effect:** Team dashboard won't attempt SSE connections for round updates

- **File:** `hooks/useTeamUpdates.ts`
- **Change:** Hook now returns mock state
- **Effect:** Admin dashboard won't attempt SSE connections for team updates

### 4. **Already Disabled in Components**

- **File:** `app/investment/play/components/TeamDashboard.tsx`
- **Status:** SSE was already commented out in this component

## Current State

âœ… **SSE Completely Disabled**

- No new connections can be established
- No broadcasting of messages
- All hooks return mock states
- Components won't attempt to connect

## Testing

1. **Start the server:** `pnpm dev`
2. **Check console:** Should see no SSE connection logs
3. **Navigate to pages:** Should work normally without SSE
4. **Admin functions:** Round status changes and team updates should work (but won't broadcast)

## Re-enabling SSE

To re-enable SSE functionality:

1. **Uncomment SSE endpoint** in `app/api/teams/events/route.ts`
2. **Uncomment broadcasting** in round-status and team route files
3. **Restore SSE hooks** in the hook files
4. **Uncomment SSE usage** in TeamDashboard.tsx

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** without SSE to ensure it works properly
2. **Identify the root cause** of infinite connections
3. **Fix the SSE implementation** to prevent connection loops
4. **Re-enable SSE** with proper connection management
